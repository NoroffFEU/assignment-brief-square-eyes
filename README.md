![Square Eyes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-two/master/SquareEyes_Logo.png)

A video streaming website for independent filmmakers to stream videos on a pay-per-view basis. There are two main types of users for the site: those selling the films they've produced, and another watching the videos that are being made.

The website should emphasise that the films are independently produced and that they are crafted by people who are passionate about making films, for people who are passionate about watching high quality films.

### Slogan
Connecting Film-Lovers

### Target audience
#### Content producers 
Aged 20 to 35 whose interests are film-making and want to make money from short films they are producing.

#### Content watchers
Aged 25 to 40 and are interested in cinema. They enjoy watching interesting and engaging films.

### Unique selling points
For the content producers: Financially benefitting from the films they've produced, a wider reach than they might have had otherwise.
For content watchers: Supporting small filmmakers and discovering interesting films.
